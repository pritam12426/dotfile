## Temp

Here’s a curated list of popular self-hosted CLI (or daemon + CLI/web UI) tools that people who love Syncthing, rclone, and aria2 tend to really enjoy. They’re all open-source, run on your own hardware (Linux, Raspberry Pi, NAS, VPS, etc.), and give you full control over your data.

### File Sync / Backup / Transfer
- **restic** – Fast, efficient, deduplicated, encrypted backups (like rclone serve + backup)
- **rclone** – (you already know) Swiss army knife for cloud storage
- **duplicati** – Backup tool with GUI but also strong CLI, encryption, deduplication
- **borgbackup** / **borgmatic** – Deduplicated, encrypted, compressed backups (very popular in the self-hosted community)
- **rsync** + **rsync daemon** – The classic, still unbeatable for local/LAN sync
- **seafile-cli** (Seafile sync client) – Dropbox-like sync but fully self-hosted
- **nextcloudcmd** (Nextcloud CLI client) – For syncing with your Nextcloud instance without the full desktop client
- **zrepl** – ZFS replication tool (if you’re into ZFS)

### Download Managers (like aria2)
- **yt-dlp** – The ultimate YouTube + 10,000 sites downloader (successor to youtube-dl)
- **motrix** (has CLI mode) – But most people use:
- **jdownloader2** (headless mode) – Powerful for hosters (rapidgator, uploaded, etc.)
- **persepolis** – GUI for aria2, but you can just use aria2c directly
- **axel** – Lightweight multi-threaded downloader
- **lftp** – Extremely powerful FTP/HTTP/SFTP client with mirroring, queuing, etc.

### File Sharing / Remote Access
- **croc** – Simple, secure, p2p file transfer (like magic-wormhole but easier)
- **magic-wormhole** – Send files point-to-point with a code
- **transfer.sh** (self-hosted version) or **pingvin-share**, **gossa** – Tiny file servers
- **filebrowser** – Web-based file manager with CLI-like feel
- **miniserve** – One-line static file server with upload support

### Media / Torrent / Automation
- **qbittorrent-nox** – Headless qBittorrent (web UI + excellent CLI control via qbittorrent-api)
- **transmission-daemon** – Lightweight torrent client with remote CLI/web control
- **rtorrent** + **ruTorrent** (web UI) – Classic CLI torrent client loved by power users
- **sonarr**, **radarr**, **lidarr**, **readarr**, **prowlarr** – The *arr suite (automation for TV, movies, music, books)
- **bazarr** – Subtitle management
- **jellyfin** / **plex** (with CLI tools) – Media servers

### Storage & Filesystem Tools
- **mergerfs** + **snapraid** – Poor-man’s ZFS/Unraid setup
- **btrfs** + **btrbk** or **snapper** – Snapshot-based backups
- **vdo** + **lvmcache** – Deduplication/compression at block level
- **zfs** (OpenZFS) – The king of advanced filesystems

### Networking / Tunneling
- **tailscale** / **headscale** (self-hosted control server) – Zero-config VPN
- **wireguard** – Fast, modern VPN
- **frp** / **ngrok** (self-hosted alternatives: **inlets**, **ztncui**, **wstunnel**)
- **cloudflared** (Argo Tunnel) – Expose services without opening ports

### Miscellaneous Gems
- **healthchecks.io** (self-hosted version: **Healthchecks**) – Monitor your cron jobs / backups
- **changedetection.io** – Watch webpages for changes
- **uptime-kuma** – Monitor your services
- **watchtower** – Auto-update your Docker containers
- **cronicle** – Better cron replacement with web UI + CLI
- **mosh** – Better SSH for mobile connections
- **tmux** / **zellij** – Terminal multiplexers (you probably already use tmux)
- **fd**, **ripgrep (rg)**, **dust**, **duf**, **btop**, **gping** – Modern CLI replacements for find, grep, du, df, top, ping

If you want the "Syncthing + rclone + aria2 vibe" specifically (decentralized, efficient, no vendor lock-in), the absolute favorites in the community right now are:

- restic or borgbackup
- qbittorrent-nox or rtorrent
- yt-dlp
- tailscale/headscale
- the entire *arr stack
